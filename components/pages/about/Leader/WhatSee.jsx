                                <p>Since our company&apos;s inception in 1993, we have been guided by two straightforward maxims: first, conduct business ethically; and second, invest in your team because they ARE the business. In less than three decades, Balance On Life Management has expanded from just five apartment communities to the 22nd largest multifamily owner-operator in the country and the 8th largest multifamily management company in the country. These people serve as our proud leaders, embodying our values and paving the way for innovative approaches to building environments where people can live and thrive.</p>

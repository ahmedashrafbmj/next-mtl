                                <p>It&apos;s time to get the tape measure out! The size of your current furniture, such as your bed, dresser, nightstands, couch, coffee table, dining table, etc., should be measured.</p>
                                <p className="pt-2">Use these measurements to obtain an idea of how to arrange your furniture when you tour an apartment or look at a floor plan online. To help you assess whether your furniture will fit, consider the following general guidelines:</p>
                                <ul className="pt-2" style={{ listStyle: "inside" }}>
                                    <li>On either side of your bed, there should be at least three feet of room. Make sure to leave enough space between your dresser and the bed if you decide to put it on one side of the bed.</li>
                                    <li>About two-thirds of the length of the living room should be occupied by sofas.</li>
                                    <li>Your sofa and coffee table should be separated by eighteen inches.</li>
                                    <li>The coffee table&apos;s edge should be thirty inches away from the TV or wall in front of it.</li>
                                    <li>Your dining table chairs and the wall should be separated by thirty inches.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p className="pt-2">If arranging your furniture in your apartment feels like putting together a huge jigsaw puzzle, take into account these suggestions:</p>
                                <ul className="pt-2" style={{ listStyle: "inside" }}>
                                    <li>To make more room in your bedroom, place your dresser inside a big closet.</li>
                                    <li>Use padded ottomans as additional seating for visitors or as coffee tables.</li>
                                    <li>Select a dining table with extendable leaves so that you can change the size.</li>

If you leave the tub running and it leaks downstairs, damaging your neighbor&apos;s furniture, you may be liable for your neighbors property. If your building went up in flames, your landlord&apos;s coverage would include repairs, but only to the building, not to the possessions of tenants.</li>
